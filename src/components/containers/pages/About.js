        <b>Ogadonate</b> is a digital marketplace that connects
        individuals/groups who have personal, social or community needs to
        people ( individual or corporate) who are willing to donate IDLE ITEMS
        which are auctioned through our solution to meet their needs and track
        the record of such corporate or individual social responsibility.<br/>Even
        though there are over twenty (20) donation platforms in Nigeria, our
        uniqueness lies in our ability to connect persons willing to donate
        ITEMS they no longer need , in the form they are donated or sold for
        cash and remitted to individuals, startups or community groups.<br/> It is
        the first of its kind seeking to optimize giving and keep account of
        such social responsibility for future digital currency reward.
         We are also able to repair, remodel or refurbish some of these items that would
        have constituted a nuisance to the environment.<br/> Our target customers are
        those people, communities or change makers in need, and matching them
        with those who have idle items and are willing to let go of this idle
        items either anonymously or to boost their corporate/individual social
        responsibility records.<br/> There are a large number of idle items wasting
        away in different homes, organizations, schools whereas there are
        persons who are in dire need of these items. Idle items include but not
        limited to furniture, land and building, art works, jewelries, clothing,
        homes appliances, equipment, vehicles, game console, spoons etc. 
    
        <h3 className='text-center'> <b>WHY GIVE OR BUY ON OGADONATE?</b></h3>
        Not about us but about the difference you love
        to make happen. OgaDonate empowers you or your business to give or buy
        an idle item to effect the change you care about. <br/> There is so much an
        individual can do to affect a change and in the absence of cash, you are
        able to give an item to support a cause, collaborating with others to
        make a huge/profound difference you alone could not have made. At
        OGADONATE we donâ€™t just connect you to the cause that matters, we
        empower those with verified needs or causes: preventive or curative; we
        provide you with feedback information on how your giving is utilized.
        And when you buy from the platform, you are not just buying at the most
        affordable price anywhere but you are helping someone meet a need or
        advance a cause.
